Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""An institution decides to distribute scholarships but can obviously not give them to everyone. Therefore, they decide to distribute them based on grades, annual income and whether that person already received any scholarships. In short, a person can only be eligible for a scholarship if their grades are excellent or good, they earn less than 50000 a year and have not received any other scholarship yet. All the other cases make that the person is not eligible for that scholarship.
"""



A: The description decides the eligibility criteria for distributing scholarships based on three factors: grades, annual income, and prior scholarship receipt. A person is eligible for a scholarship if they have excellent or good grades, earn less than $50,000 a year, and have not received any other scholarships. All other cases result in ineligibility for the scholarship.

Q: Is a student with good grades and an annual income of 33000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: Yes, a student with good grades (good is considered eligible), an annual income of $33,000 (which is less than $50,000), and no other scholarships assigned is eligible for the scholarship.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are: 
1. Grades (which can be classified as excellent or good),
2. Annual income (specifically whether it is less than $50,000), and 
3. Prior scholarship receipt (whether the person has received any other scholarships).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: Here is an overview of the input and output variables, including their data types and possible values:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - **Grades**
     - **Data Type:** Categorical
     - **Possible Values:** 
       - Excellent
       - Good
       - Fair (not eligible)
       - Poor (not eligible)

   - **Annual Income**
     - **Data Type:** Numeric (continuous)
     - **Possible Values:** 
       - Any numeric value (but eligibility requires it to be less than $50,000)

   - **Prior Scholarship Receipt**
     - **Data Type:** Boolean
     - **Possible Values:** 
       - Yes (has received other scholarships, not eligible)
       - No (has not received other scholarships, eligible)

2. **Output Variable:**
   - **Eligibility for Scholarship**
     - **Data Type:** Boolean
     - **Possible Values:** 
       - Yes (eligible for scholarship)
       - No (not eligible for scholarship)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variable, which is **Annual Income**, are as follows:

- **Relevant Value for Eligibility:** 
  - Must be less than $50,000 to be considered eligible for the scholarship.

- **Non-Relevant Values:** 
  - Any value equal to or greater than $50,000 makes a person ineligible for the scholarship.

Thus, the specific relevant range for the Annual Income variable is any numeric value from $0 up to but not including $50,000.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table that represents the eligibility criteria for the scholarship based on the provided description. The table is structured horizontally, with column headers for inputs and the output.

| Grades   | Annual Income < $50,000 | Prior Scholarship Receipt | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent| Yes                     | No                        | Yes                         |
| Excellent| Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |

| Fair     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |

In this decision table:
- Each row represents a unique combination of input values.
- The "Eligibility for Scholarship" column indicates whether the person is eligible (Yes) or not eligible (No) based on the specified criteria.

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is a revised DMN decision table that ensures the rules are mutually exclusive. Each combination of input values leads to a unique outcome for eligibility, preventing any overlap.

| Grades   | Annual Income < $50,000 | Prior Scholarship Receipt | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent| Yes                     | No                        | Yes                         |
| Excellent| Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Good     | Yes                     | No                        | Yes                         |
| Good     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Good     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Good     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Fair     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |

In this table:
- Each row is distinct and covers all possible combinations of the input variables.
- The eligibility outcomes are clearly defined without any overlap, ensuring mutual exclusivity among the rules.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The provided decision table is not complete because it does not account for all possible combinations of the input variables. Specifically, it does not include cases where the annual income is equal to or greater than $50,000, which would affect eligibility.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- **Grades:** Excellent
- **Annual Income:** $50,000 (not less than $50,000)
- **Prior Scholarship Receipt:** No

In this case, there is no applicable rule in the current decision table, as the table only considers cases where the annual income is strictly less than $50,000. Therefore, this scenario is a valid example where no rule would be applicable, indicating that the table is incomplete. 

To make the table complete, we need to add rules for cases where the annual income is equal to or exceeds $50,000, regardless of grades and prior scholarship receipt. Hereâ€™s how the updated table could look:

| Grades   | Annual Income < $50,000 | Prior Scholarship Receipt | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent| Yes                     | No                        | Yes                         |
| Excellent| Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Excellent| No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Good     | Yes                     | No                        | Yes                         |
| Good     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Good     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Good     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Fair     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Fair     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | Yes                     | Yes                       | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Poor     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |
| Any     | No                      | No                        | No                          |
| Any     | No                      | Yes                       | No                          |

In this updated table:
- The last two rows cover cases where the annual income is equal to or greater than $50,000, ensuring that all input combinations are accounted for.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a student with excellent grades and an annual income of 88000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: According to the updated decision table, a student with excellent grades and an annual income of $88,000 (which is not less than $50,000) is not eligible for the scholarship, regardless of having no other scholarships assigned. Therefore, the answer is No; the student is not eligible for the scholarship.
