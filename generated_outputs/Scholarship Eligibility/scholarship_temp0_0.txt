Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""An institution decides to distribute scholarships but can obviously not give them to everyone. Therefore, they decide to distribute them based on grades, annual income and whether that person already received any scholarships. In short, a person can only be eligible for a scholarship if their grades are excellent or good, they earn less than 50000 a year and have not received any other scholarship yet. All the other cases make that the person is not eligible for that scholarship.
"""



A: The description decides the eligibility criteria for distributing scholarships based on three factors: grades, annual income, and prior scholarship receipt. A person is eligible for a scholarship if they have excellent or good grades, earn less than $50,000 annually, and have not received any other scholarships. If any of these conditions are not met, the person is deemed ineligible for the scholarship.

Q: Is a student with good grades and an annual income of 33000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: Yes, a student with good grades, an annual income of $33,000, and no other scholarships assigned is eligible for the scholarship. They meet all the criteria: their grades are good, their income is below $50,000, and they have not received any other scholarships.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are: 
1. Grades (which can be classified as excellent or good)
2. Annual income (specifically, whether it is less than $50,000)
3. Prior scholarship receipt (whether the person has received any other scholarships)

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: Here is an overview of the data types and possible values for each input and output:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - **Grades**:
     - **Data Type**: Categorical
     - **Possible Values**: "Excellent", "Good", "Average", "Poor" (only "Excellent" and "Good" qualify for eligibility)
   
   - **Annual Income**:
     - **Data Type**: Numeric
     - **Possible Values**: Any non-negative integer (but must be less than $50,000 to qualify)

   - **Prior Scholarship Receipt**:
     - **Data Type**: Boolean
     - **Possible Values**: True (has received other scholarships), False (has not received other scholarships)

2. **Output Variable:**
   - **Eligibility for Scholarship**:
     - **Data Type**: Boolean
     - **Possible Values**: True (eligible for scholarship), False (not eligible for scholarship)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variable, which is **Annual Income**, are as follows:

- **Relevant Range**: Any non-negative integer value that is less than $50,000.
- **Specific Values**: 
  - Minimum: $0 (indicating no income)
  - Maximum: $49,999 (the highest income that still qualifies for eligibility)

Values equal to or greater than $50,000 do not qualify for scholarship eligibility.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table that represents the eligibility criteria for the scholarship based on the provided description. The table is structured horizontally, with column headers for inputs and output.

| Grades   | Annual Income | Prior Scholarship Receipt | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent| < 50,000     | False                    | True                        |
| Excellent| < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Excellent| ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Excellent| ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Good     | < 50,000     | False                    | True                        |
| Good     | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Good     | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Good     | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Average  | < 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Average  | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Average  | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Average  | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Poor     | < 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Poor     | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Poor     | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Poor     | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |

In this table:
- "Grades" can be "Excellent", "Good", "Average", or "Poor".
- "Annual Income" is categorized as "< 50,000" or "≥ 50,000".
- "Prior Scholarship Receipt" is either "True" (has received other scholarships) or "False" (has not received any other scholarships).
- The output "Eligibility for Scholarship" indicates whether the individual is eligible (True) or not eligible (False) based on the input conditions.

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is a revised DMN decision table that ensures the rules are mutually exclusive. Each combination of input values leads to a unique output, eliminating any overlap.

| Grades   | Annual Income | Prior Scholarship Receipt | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent| < 50,000     | False                    | True                        |
| Excellent| < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Excellent| ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Excellent| ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Good     | < 50,000     | False                    | True                        |
| Good     | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Good     | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Good     | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Average  | < 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Average  | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Average  | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Average  | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Poor     | < 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Poor     | < 50,000     | True                     | False                       |
| Poor     | ≥ 50,000     | False                    | False                       |
| Poor     | ≥ 50,000     | True                     | False                       |

In this table:
- Each row represents a unique combination of inputs.
- The conditions are structured so that no two rows can be true at the same time, ensuring mutual exclusivity.
- The output "Eligibility for Scholarship" clearly indicates whether the individual is eligible (True) or not eligible (False) based on the specific input conditions.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The table is complete in terms of the defined eligibility criteria based on the inputs provided. However, it does not account for all possible combinations of input values, particularly when considering the range of annual income.

For example, if we consider a case where:
- **Grades**: "Average"
- **Annual Income**: $50,000 (exactly)
- **Prior Scholarship Receipt**: False

In this scenario, there is no applicable rule in the current table because:
- The "Average" grade with an income of $50,000 does not meet any of the conditions for eligibility (as the income must be less than $50,000).
- The table does not explicitly cover the case where the income is exactly $50,000, which means that this combination of inputs lacks a corresponding rule.

Thus, the table is incomplete as it does not provide a rule for this specific set of inputs. To ensure completeness, we would need to add rules that account for cases where the annual income is exactly $50,000, as well as any other potential edge cases.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a student with excellent grades and an annual income of 88000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: No, a student with excellent grades and an annual income of $88,000 is not eligible for the scholarship, even if they have no other scholarships assigned. According to the decision table, the eligibility criteria state that the annual income must be less than $50,000 to qualify. Since the student's income exceeds this threshold, they do not meet the eligibility requirements for the scholarship.
