Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""An institution decides to distribute scholarships but can obviously not give them to everyone. Therefore, they decide to distribute them based on grades, annual income and whether that person already received any scholarships. In short, a person can only be eligible for a scholarship if their grades are excellent or good, they earn less than 50000 a year and have not received any other scholarship yet. All the other cases make that the person is not eligible for that scholarship.
"""



A: This description decides the eligibility criteria for distributing scholarships based on three factors: grades (must be excellent or good), annual income (must be less than $50,000), and previous scholarship status (must not have received any other scholarships). If a person meets all these conditions, they are eligible for a scholarship; otherwise, they are not.

Q: Is a student with good grades and an annual income of 33000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: Yes, a student with good grades (good) and an annual income of $33,000 is eligible for the scholarship since he meets all the required conditions: his grades are good, his income is less than $50,000, and he has not received any other scholarships.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are grades (which can be categorized as excellent or good), annual income (which must be less than $50,000), and previous scholarship status (which must indicate that the person has not received any other scholarships).

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: Here's the overview of the inputs and outputs, including their data types and possible values:

**Inputs:**

1. **Grades**
   - **Data Type:** Categorical
   - **Possible Values:** 
     - Excellent
     - Good
     - (Implied) Fair
     - (Implied) Poor

2. **Annual Income**
   - **Data Type:** Numeric
   - **Possible Values:** Any numeric value, but relevant range is less than $50,000 (e.g., $0 to $49,999).

3. **Previous Scholarship Status**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean (True/False)
   - **Possible Values:**
     - True (indicating the person has received a scholarship)
     - False (indicating the person has not received a scholarship)

**Output:**

1. **Eligibility for Scholarship**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean
   - **Possible Values:**
     - True (eligible for scholarship)
     - False (not eligible for scholarship)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variable, which is Annual Income, are as follows:

- **Data Type:** Numeric
- **Relevant Range**: Any numeric value less than $50,000
- **Possible Values**: 
  - Minimum Value: $0 (the lowest possible income)
  - Maximum Value: $49,999 (the highest income that still qualifies for eligibility)
  
In essence, all values from $0 to $49,999 are relevant for determining eligibility for the scholarship based on annual income.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table based on the provided scholarship eligibility criteria. The table is structured horizontally with column headers for the inputs and output.

| Grades   | Annual Income | Previous Scholarship Status | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent | < $50,000    | False                      | True                        |
| Excellent | < $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Excellent | ≥ $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Excellent | ≥ $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Good      | < $50,000    | False                      | True                        |
| Good      | < $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Good      | ≥ $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Good      | ≥ $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Fair      | < $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Fair      | < $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Fair      | ≥ $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Fair      | ≥ $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Poor      | < $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Poor      | < $50,000    | True                       | False                       |
| Poor      | ≥ $50,000    | False                      | False                       |
| Poor      | ≥ $50,000    | True                       | False                       |

In this decision table:

- The **Grades** column has values of Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor.
- The **Annual Income** column is represented as either less than $50,000 or greater than or equal to $50,000.
- The **Previous Scholarship Status** displays whether the person has previously received a scholarship (True or False).
- The **Eligibility for Scholarship** output shows whether the person is eligible (True) or not (False) based on the given conditions.

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is the updated DMN decision table structured to ensure mutual exclusivity for the rules, meaning that each combination of inputs results in a unique output without any overlap.

| Grades    | Annual Income         | Previous Scholarship Status | Eligibility for Scholarship |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Excellent | < $50,000            | False                      | True                        |
| Excellent | < $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Excellent | ≥ $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Excellent | ≥ $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Good      | < $50,000            | False                      | True                        |
| Good      | < $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Good      | ≥ $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Good      | ≥ $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Fair      | < $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Fair      | < $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Fair      | ≥ $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Fair      | ≥ $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Poor      | < $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Poor      | < $50,000            | True                       | False                       |
| Poor      | ≥ $50,000            | False                      | False                       |
| Poor      | ≥ $50,000            | True                       | False                       |

In this decision table:

- The conditions are clearly defined to ensure no overlap exists between the entries.
- The rules for **Grades** remain at Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor.
- The **Annual Income** categories are maintained as less than $50,000 and greater than or equal to $50,000, ensuring each case is handled distinctly.
- The **Previous Scholarship Status** is handled in conjunction with the other factors, allowing unique determinations for eligibility based on the combination of all three inputs. 

Thus, the combination of these factors maintains clarity without ambiguity, making them mutually exclusive.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The table is not complete, as there are scenarios for which no rule would be applicable based on the current definitions and categorizations.

For instance, while the input for **Grades** includes categories of Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor, there is no rule defined for a grade that would fall outside these predefined categories. Given that grades can theoretically also be "Very Poor" or "Average," any student with those grades would not match any existing rules in the table.

Another potential situation that could lead to an undefined scenario is if there was ambiguity regarding the income value. For example, if the income were exactly $50,000, this specific case is covered under “≥ $50,000,” but it does not provide clarity if aligning thresholds should categorize it differently.

Additionally, the table does not account for variations in grading systems (e.g., Pass/Fail) or other unconsidered conditions that might relate to scholarship eligibility.

**Example of an Undefined Scenario:**
- A student receives an "Average" grade (not defined in the table), has an annual income of $45,000, and has not received any previous scholarships.
  
In this scenario, because "Average" is not defined in the **Grades** column, there is no applicable rule that would apply to this set of inputs; hence, the table is incomplete.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a student with excellent grades and an annual income of 88000 eligible if he has no other scholarships assigned?

A: According to the table, a student with excellent grades and an annual income of $88,000 would not be eligible for the scholarship, even if they have no other scholarships assigned. This is because their annual income exceeds the threshold of $50,000 required for eligibility. Therefore, the output for this scenario would be **False** (not eligible for the scholarship).
