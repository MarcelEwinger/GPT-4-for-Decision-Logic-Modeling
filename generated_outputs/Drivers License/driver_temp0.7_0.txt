Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""Whether a person is eligible to get their driver's license depends on their age, on being a national resident and on if they have sufficient practical skills. The practical skills are evaluated based on theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvring skills and anticipation capabilities. Each of these aspects is evaluated with 'Excellent', 'Good' or 'Fail'. A person only passes the practical skills if they have no fails on any of the 4 aspects making up the practical skills. A person can only receive their driver's license if they are 18 or more, are a national resident and passed their practical skills test.
"""



A: The description decides the eligibility criteria for obtaining a driver's license, which includes age (18 or older), national residency, and passing a practical skills test that evaluates theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvering skills, and anticipation capabilities without any fails in these areas.

Q: Is a 23 year old person who did not pass their practical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's license?

A: No, a 23 year old person who did not pass their practical test is not eligible for a driver's license, regardless of being a national resident, because they failed to meet the requirement of passing the practical skills test.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are age, national residency status, and the results of the practical skills test, which is assessed based on four aspects: theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvering skills, and anticipation capabilities. Each of these aspects can be rated as 'Excellent', 'Good', or 'Fail'.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: 

1. **Input Variables:**
   - **Age**
     - **Data Type:** Integer
     - **Possible Values:** Any integer value (typically focusing on values 18 and above for eligibility).
   
   - **National Residency Status**
     - **Data Type:** Boolean
     - **Possible Values:** 
       - `True` (the person is a national resident)
       - `False` (the person is not a national resident)

   - **Practical Skills Test Results**
     - **Data Type:** List or Array of Strings
     - **Possible Values:** Each aspect can have one of the following values:
       - `'Excellent'`
       - `'Good'`
       - `'Fail'`
     - There are four aspects to evaluate: theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvering skills, and anticipation capabilities.

2. **Output Variable:**
   - **Eligibility for Driver's License**
     - **Data Type:** Boolean
     - **Possible Values:**
       - `True` (the person is eligible for a driver's license)
       - `False` (the person is not eligible for a driver's license)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are as follows:

1. **Age**
   - **Relevant Values:** Any integer value starting from 18 and above is relevant for eligibility. Common examples include:
     - 18 (minimum age to be eligible)
     - 19, 20, 21, ... up to any upper limit (e.g., 100+), though in practical scenarios, typical ages would be between 18 and 70 or so.

2. **Practical Skills Test Results**
   - Although this part does not involve numerical variables directly, the evaluation of practical skills could be quantified in terms of the number of fails:
     - 0 fails (passing condition)
     - 1 fail (not passing)
     - 2 fails (not passing)
     - 3 fails (not passing)
     - 4 fails (not passing)
   - The presence of any fails in the four aspects will result in a failure of the practical skills test, which is relevant for the decision-making process.

In summary, the primary numerical variable is age, where only values 18 and above are relevant, while the practical skills assessment indirectly influences the outcome based on the count of fails.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table that represents the decision-making logic for determining eligibility for a driver's license based on the described criteria. The table is organized horizontally with inputs as column headers and the output indicating eligibility.

| **Age** | **National Resident** | **Theoretical Knowledge** | **Driving Skills** | **Maneuvering Skills** | **Anticipation Capabilities** | **Eligibility for Driver's License** |

| 18 or older | True              | Fail                      | Fail                | Any                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True              | Any                       | Fail                | Fail                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True              | Fail                      | Any                 | Fail                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | False             | Any                       | Any                 | Any                     | Any                           | False                                 |

### Notes:
- The first row indicates individuals under 18 who are automatically ineligible.
- The subsequent rows show various combinations of skill ratings (Excellent, Good, Fail) for individuals who are 18 or older and national residents.
- If any aspect of the practical skills assessment results in a 'Fail', the person is deemed ineligible.
- Individuals who are not national residents are also ineligible, regardless of their age or skill levels.

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is a revised DMN decision table where the rules have been made mutually exclusive, ensuring that each combination of inputs results in a unique output without overlap.

| **Age**     | **National Resident** | **Theoretical Knowledge** | **Driving Skills** | **Maneuvering Skills** | **Anticipation Capabilities** | **Eligibility for Driver's License** |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

| 18 or older | True                  | Excellent                 | Excellent           | Good                     | Fail                          | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True                  | Excellent                 | Good                | Excellent                | Excellent                     | True                                  |

| 18 or older | True                  | Good                      | Excellent           | Excellent               | Excellent                     | True                                  |
| 18 or older | True                  | Good                      | Excellent           | Good                     | Good                          | True                                  |
| 18 or older | True                  | Good                      | Good                | Good                     | Good                          | True                                  |
| 18 or older | True                  | Good                      | Any                 | Any                     | Fail                          | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True                  | Fail                      | Any                 | Any                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True                  | Any                       | Fail                | Any                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | True                  | Any                       | Any                 | Fail                     | Any                           | False                                 |
| 18 or older | False                 | Any                       | Any                 | Any                     | Any                           | False                                 |

### Notes:
- The first row indicates individuals under 18 who are automatically ineligible.
- The subsequent rows show various combinations of skill ratings (Excellent, Good, Fail) for individuals who are 18 or older and national residents.
- Each combination of skills and residency status leads to a unique eligibility outcome.
- If any aspect of the practical skills assessment results in a 'Fail', the person is deemed ineligible.
- Individuals who are not national residents are also ineligible, regardless of their age or skill levels.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The provided decision table is not complete, as there are combinations of inputs for which no rule would be applicable. Specifically, the table does not account for the situation where an individual is 18 or older, a national resident, and has mixed ratings that do not fit the existing rules.

### Example of an Incomplete Rule:
1. **Age:** 18 or older
2. **National Resident:** True
3. **Theoretical Knowledge:** Good
4. **Driving Skills:** Fail
5. **Maneuvering Skills:** Excellent
6. **Anticipation Capabilities:** Good

In this case, the individual is 18 or older and a national resident, and while they have a combination of ratings, the rule set does not explicitly cover the scenario where they have a 'Fail' in one area (driving skills) while having 'Good' or 'Excellent' in others. This situation would lead to ambiguity regarding eligibility, as it does not clearly match any existing rule in the table.

### Conclusion:
To make the table complete, we need to include specific rules for cases where an individual has mixed skill evaluations, particularly when any single aspect results in a 'Fail', regardless of the ratings in the other areas. This will ensure that all possible combinations of inputs are accounted for with corresponding outcomes.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a 32 year old person that failed the theoretical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's licence?

A: No, a 32 year old person who failed the theoretical test and is a national resident is not eligible for a driver's license. According to the decision table, any individual who has a 'Fail' in any aspect of the practical skills assessment, including theoretical knowledge, is automatically deemed ineligible, regardless of age or residency status.
