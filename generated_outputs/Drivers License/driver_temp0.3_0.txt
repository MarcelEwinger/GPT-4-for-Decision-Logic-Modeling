Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""Whether a person is eligible to get their driver's license depends on their age, on being a national resident and on if they have sufficient practical skills. The practical skills are evaluated based on theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvring skills and anticipation capabilities. Each of these aspects is evaluated with 'Excellent', 'Good' or 'Fail'. A person only passes the practical skills if they have no fails on any of the 4 aspects making up the practical skills. A person can only receive their driver's license if they are 18 or more, are a national resident and passed their practical skills test.
"""



A: The description decides whether a person is eligible to obtain a driver's license based on their age, national residency, and the evaluation of their practical driving skills.

Q: Is a 23 year old person who did not pass their practical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's license?

A: No, a 23-year-old person who did not pass their practical test is not eligible for a driver's license, even though they are a national resident, because passing the practical skills test is a requirement.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are: age (must be 18 or older), national residency status (must be a national resident), and the evaluation of practical skills (assessed through theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvering skills, and anticipation capabilities, with each aspect rated as 'Excellent', 'Good', or 'Fail').

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: Here is an overview of the input and output variables, their data types, and possible values:

**Inputs:**

1. **Age**
   - **Data Type:** Integer
   - **Possible Values:** Any integer value (typically 0 and above), but relevant values for eligibility are 18 and older.

2. **National Residency Status**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean (True/False)
   - **Possible Values:** 
     - True (the person is a national resident)
     - False (the person is not a national resident)

3. **Practical Skills Evaluation**
   - **Data Type:** List/Array of Strings
   - **Possible Values:** Each aspect can be rated as:
     - 'Excellent'
     - 'Good'
     - 'Fail'
   - There are four aspects to evaluate: 
     - Theoretical Knowledge
     - Driving Skills
     - Maneuvering Skills
     - Anticipation Capabilities

**Outputs:**

1. **Eligibility for Driver's License**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean (True/False)
   - **Possible Values:** 
     - True (the person is eligible for a driver's license)
     - False (the person is not eligible for a driver's license)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variables are as follows:

1. **Age**
   - **Relevant Values:** Any integer value of 18 or older is considered relevant for eligibility. Values below 18 are not relevant for this decision.

For the other variables, such as national residency status and practical skills evaluation, there are no numerical values; they are categorical or boolean in nature.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table formatted to be read horizontally, with the column headers containing the inputs and output based on the provided description.

| Age | National Resident | Theoretical Knowledge | Driving Skills | Maneuvering Skills | Anticipation Capabilities | Eligibility for Driver's License |
|-----|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 17  | False             | Any                  | Any            | Any                | Any                       | False                            |
| 17  | True              | Any                  | Any            | Any                | Any                       | False                            |

### Notes:
- "Any" indicates that the value can be any of the possible ratings ('Excellent', 'Good', or 'Fail') for that aspect.
- The eligibility is only true when the person is 18 or older, is a national resident, and has passed all practical skills evaluations (i.e., no 'Fail' in any aspect).

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is the revised DMN decision table with mutually exclusive rules, ensuring that each combination of inputs leads to a unique output for eligibility based on the provided description.

### Notes:
- The age conditions are explicitly defined as "<18" or "18" and above.
- Each combination of practical skills evaluations is accounted for, ensuring that there are no overlaps in eligibility outcomes.
- The eligibility is only true when the person is 18 or older, is a national resident, and has passed all practical skills evaluations (i.e., no 'Fail' in any aspect).

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The table provided is not complete. There are scenarios for which no rule would be applicable, particularly concerning the age variable and the practical skills evaluations.

For example, consider the following input scenario:

- **Age:** 19
- **National Resident:** True
- **Theoretical Knowledge:** Excellent
- **Driving Skills:** Good
- **Maneuvering Skills:** Good
- **Anticipation Capabilities:** Fail

In this case, while the person is 19 years old and a national resident, they have failed one of the practical skills evaluations (Anticipation Capabilities). However, there is no specific rule in the table that addresses this exact combination of inputs, as the rules do not cover all possible combinations of ratings for the practical skills evaluation when the person is 19 years old.

To make the table complete, we need to ensure that every possible combination of inputs has an associated output. This means explicitly defining rules for all combinations of practical skills evaluations for each age and residency status. 

### Example of Incomplete Rule:
- **Input Scenario:** 
  - Age: 19
  - National Resident: True
  - Theoretical Knowledge: Excellent
  - Driving Skills: Good
  - Maneuvering Skills: Good
  - Anticipation Capabilities: Fail
- **Applicable Rule:** None (as per the current table)

To rectify this, we should add rules that account for all combinations of practical skills evaluations for ages 18 and above, ensuring that each unique combination results in a defined eligibility outcome.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a 32 year old person that failed the theoretical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's licence?

A: According to the table, a 32-year-old person who failed the theoretical test and is a national resident is not eligible for a driver's license. Since they have failed one of the practical skills evaluations (theoretical knowledge), they do not meet the requirement of passing all practical skills evaluations, which includes having no 'Fail' in any aspect. Therefore, their eligibility is False.
