Q: We will ask you a series of questions on Decision Model and Notation tables. Each question starts with "Q:", and each response should start with "A:". Below is a decision description, between quotation marks.  What does this description decide?

"""Whether a person is eligible to get their driver's license depends on their age, on being a national resident and on if they have sufficient practical skills. The practical skills are evaluated based on theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvring skills and anticipation capabilities. Each of these aspects is evaluated with 'Excellent', 'Good' or 'Fail'. A person only passes the practical skills if they have no fails on any of the 4 aspects making up the practical skills. A person can only receive their driver's license if they are 18 or more, are a national resident and passed their practical skills test.
"""



A: This description decides the eligibility of a person to obtain a driver's license based on their age, residency status, and evaluation of practical driving skills.

Q: Is a 23 year old person who did not pass their practical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's license?

A: No, a 23-year-old person who did not pass their practical test is not eligible for a driver's license, even though they are a national resident. They must pass the practical skills test to be eligible.

Q: What are the variables that influence this decision?

A: The variables that influence this decision are age, national residency status, and the evaluation of practical skills, which includes theoretical knowledge, driving skills, maneuvering skills, and anticipation capabilities.

Q: For each input and output, give me an overview of their data type and their possible values.

A: 

**Inputs:**

1. **Age**
   - **Data Type:** Integer
   - **Possible Values:** Any integer value, but specifically values 0 and above; for eligibility, the minimum value is 18.

2. **National Residency Status**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean (Yes/No)
   - **Possible Values:** 
     - Yes (is a national resident)
     - No (is not a national resident)

3. **Practical Skills Evaluation**
   - **Data Type:** Array or List of Strings
   - **Possible Values:** 
     - 'Excellent'
     - 'Good'
     - 'Fail'
   - **Note:** There are four aspects evaluated, and to pass, there must be no 'Fail' in any of the four aspects.

**Outputs:**

1. **Eligibility for Driver's License**
   - **Data Type:** Boolean (Yes/No)
   - **Possible Values:**
     - Yes (eligible for driver's license)
     - No (not eligible for driver's license)

Q: What are the relevant values of the numerical variables?

A: The relevant values of the numerical variable, which is **Age**, are:

1. **Minimum Value:** 18 (the minimum age required to be eligible for a driver's license).
2. **Maximum Value:** There is no specified upper limit in the description; therefore, any integer value 18 and above is considered relevant for eligibility purposes.

In summary, the relevant values for Age are integers starting from 18 up to any maximum value, as long as the person meets the other criteria for eligibility.

Q: Could you generate a DMN decision table for this description? Make sure the table can be read horizontally: the column headers contain the inputs and output.

A: Below is a DMN decision table structured horizontally with inputs and the output based on the provided description:

| Age (≥ 18) | National Resident | Practical Skills Evaluation                  | Eligibility for Driver's License |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 18         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Good'] | Yes                               |
| 18         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | Yes                               |
| 18         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Fail', 'Good', 'Good']      | No                                |
| 18         | No                | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Good'] | No                                |
| 23         | Yes               | ['Fail', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 20         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent'] | Yes                               |
| 17         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 25         | No                | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good'] | No                                |
| 30         | Yes               | ['Fail', 'Fail', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 22         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Fail', 'Good']           | No                                |

### Explanation:
- **Age (≥ 18):** The decision table includes inputs that are valid ages starting from 18.
- **National Resident:** This column indicates whether the person is a national resident or not.
- **Practical Skills Evaluation:** This array reflects the results of the four aspects of practical skills, and it must contain no 'Fail' for the person to be eligible.
- **Eligibility for Driver's License:** This is the output, indicating whether the person is eligible for a driver's license based on the given inputs. 

This table can be expanded with more combinations as needed, but it captures the critical decision points outlined in the original description.

Q: Make the rules mutually exclusive.

A: Below is a revised DMN decision table structured horizontally with mutually exclusive rules for each combination of inputs based on the provided description:

| Age (≥ 18) | National Resident | Practical Skills Evaluation                  | Eligibility for Driver's License |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 18         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Good'] | Yes                               |
| 18         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | Yes                               |
| 18         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Fail', 'Good', 'Good']      | No                                |
| 18         | No                | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Good'] | No                                |
| 23         | Yes               | ['Fail', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 20         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent'] | Yes                               |
| 17         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 25         | No                | ['Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Excellent', 'Good'] | No                                |
| 30         | Yes               | ['Fail', 'Fail', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 22         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Good', 'Fail', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 19         | Yes               | ['Fail', 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Good']      | No                                |
| 21         | Yes               | ['Good', 'Fail', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |
| 18         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Good', 'Fail', 'Good']      | No                                |
| 29         | Yes               | ['Excellent', 'Good', 'Excellent', 'Good'] | Yes                               |
| 24         | No                | ['Fail', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good']           | No                                |

### Explanation:
- Each row represents a unique combination of inputs, ensuring that no two rows can represent the same situation.
- The combinations of age (must be 18 or older), national residency (Yes/No), and practical skills evaluation (varied results) are structured to guarantee that every possible outcome is covered without overlap.
- This maintains the logic of the original decision-making process while ensuring clarity in eligibility determination for a driver's license.

Q: Is this table complete? (I.e., is there an applicable rule for each set of inputs?) If it is incomplete, can you find an example for which no rule would be applicable?

A: The current DMN decision table is not complete. Specifically, it does not cover all possible combinations of inputs for age, national residency status, and practical skills evaluation. 

### Example of an Inapplicable Rule:

Consider the following input combination:
- **Age:** 19 (which is greater than or equal to 18)
- **National Resident:** Yes
- **Practical Skills Evaluation:** ['Fail', 'Fail', 'Fail', 'Fail'] (all aspects have failed)

For this combination, there is no rule in the provided decision table that explicitly addresses this scenario. All four evaluations being 'Fail' means the person has not passed the practical skills test, which should lead to a conclusion of "No" for eligibility. However, this combination was not included in the existing rules.

### Additional Example of Inapplicable Rule:

Another example could be:
- **Age:** 22
- **National Resident:** No
- **Practical Skills Evaluation:** ['Excellent', 'Good', 'Good', 'Good'] (where the practical skills evaluation would have passed if residency was not a factor)

For this combination, while the practical skills evaluation suggests that the person would be eligible, their non-residency means they are not eligible. However, this specific combination is also not covered in the existing rules.

### Conclusion:
The table needs to be expanded to include more combinations, particularly those where practical skill evaluations result in 'Fail' across all aspects, as well as combinations where residency status affects eligibility directly. A thorough decision table should enumerate all relevant scenarios to ensure every possible input combination has a corresponding rule.

Q: According to your table, answer the following question.  Is a 32 year old person that failed the theoretical test and is a national resident eligible for a driver's licence?

A: According to the decision table, a 32-year-old person who failed the practical skills evaluation (assuming that failing the theoretical test translates to failing one or more of the practical skills aspects) and is a national resident would not be eligible for a driver's license. The rule states that a person can only receive their driver's license if they pass the practical skills test, which requires no 'Fail' in any of the assessed aspects. Since this individual has failed, they are not eligible for a driver's license.
