The BMI of a person can be calculated based on weight in kgs and length of a person in meters by using the following formula: weight/(length*length). If the BMI value is above 30, then the BMI-level is considered Obese. If you are a male and the BMI-value is under 18.5 then the BMI-level is severely underweight and if you are female, then you are considered underweight with the same bmi-value. If the BMI-value is between 18.5 and 25 (without 25), then the BMI-level is underweight for a male and normal for a female. Lastly, if the BMI-value is between 25 and 30 and you are a Male then the BMI-level is normal but if you are a female then BMI-level is overweight.
