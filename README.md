# GPT-4 for Decision Logic Modeling 

This repository contains the data for the course project titled [GPT-3 for Decision Logic Modeling](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/720326).
 The goal of the project was to evaluate our own prompting strategy for leveraging large language models in decision logic modeling tasks. 


The data is as follows:

* descriptions: the problem descriptions used for testing
* query.py: a Python program that runs through the Q&As and queries GPT-3 via the OpenAI API.
* generated_outputs: the outputs generated through each run
* gpt-dmn-evaluation.xlsx: the evaluation of these results, as cross-validated by both first authors
